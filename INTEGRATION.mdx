## Overview

This template provides a productionâ€‘ready Apache Cassandra instance as a Monk runnable. You can:

- Run it directly to get a managed Cassandra container with sensible defaults
- Inherit it in your own runnable to seamlessly add a distributed wide-column NoSQL database to your stack

Apache Cassandra is a highly scalable, distributed NoSQL database designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure.

## What this template manages

- Cassandra container (`cassandra` image, configurable tag)
- Network service on port 9042 (CQL native transport)
- Persistent volumes for data storage
- Authentication configuration

## Quick start (run directly)

1) Load templates

```bash
monk load MANIFEST
```

2) Run Cassandra with defaults

```bash
monk run cassandra/cassandra
```

3) Customize credentials (recommended via inheritance)

Running directly uses the defaults defined in this template's `variables`. Secrets added with `monk secrets add` will not affect this runnable unless you inherit it and reference those secrets.

- Preferred: inherit and replace variables with `secret("...")` as shown below.
- Alternative: fork/clone and edit the `variables` in `cassandra/cassandra.yml`, then `monk load MANIFEST` and run.

Once started, connect to `localhost:9042` (or the runnable hostname inside Monk networks) using CQL.

## Configuration

Key variables you can customize in this template:

```yaml
variables:
  cassandra-image: "latest"              # container image tag
  cassandra-password: "monk"             # Cassandra password (env: CASSANDRA_PASSWORD)
```

Data is persisted under `${monk-volume-path}/cassandra` on the host.

## Use by inheritance (recommended for apps)

Inherit the Cassandra runnable in your application and declare a connection. Example:

```yaml
namespace: myapp
db:
  defines: runnable
  inherits: cassandra/cassandra
api:
  defines: runnable
  containers:
    api:
      image: myorg/api
  connections:
    database:
      runnable: db
      service: cassandra
  variables:
    database-host:
      value: <- connection-hostname("database")
    database-password:
      value: <- secret("cassandra-password")
```

Then set the secrets once and run your app group:

```bash
monk secrets add -g cassandra-password="STRONG_PASSWORD"
monk run myapp/api
```

## Ports and connectivity

- Service: `cassandra` on TCP port `9042` (CQL native transport)
- From other runnables in the same process group, use `connection-hostname("<connection-name>")` to resolve the DB host.

## Persistence and configuration

- Data path: `${monk-volume-path}/cassandra:/var/lib/cassandra`
- Cassandra stores all keyspaces, tables, and data in this directory

## Related templates

- Cassandra cluster: see the `cassandra-cluster/` template in this repository for a multi-node cluster setup with seed nodes
- Combine with `spark/` for analytics workloads
- Use with `prometheus-grafana/` for monitoring and metrics

## Troubleshooting

- Cassandra may take several minutes to start, especially on first launch
- If you changed `cassandra-password` but the container has existing data, authentication may fail. Either reset the data volume or update the password inside Cassandra to match.
- Ensure the host volumes are writable by the container user.
- Check logs:

```bash
monk logs -l 500 -f local/cassandra/cassandra
```
